* About symlinks
> You only have to symlink configuration.nix. As youâ€™ve realised, the crucial fact is that the relative imports are resolved from the actual location of the file. So having symlinked in configuration.nix from machines/whatever/configuration.nix, the import ./hardware-configuration.nix resolves correctly to machines/whatever/hardware-configuration.nix.
